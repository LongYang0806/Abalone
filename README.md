Abalone
=======

Abalone game for Social Multiplayer Game class Spring 2014

You can find the description in the following link:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abalone_(board_game)

But I make a little changes:
(1). EndGame criterion: To push one of the opponent's marbles off the edge of the board.
(2). Use the "Belgian daisy starting position"
